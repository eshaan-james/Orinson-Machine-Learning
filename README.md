# Red Wine Classification

Welcome to the **Red Wine Classification** project! This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning solution for classifying red wine quality using various algorithms. The project features an interactive, multipage **Streamlit web application** for deploying and exploring the results.

## üìå Project Objective

The goal of this project is to predict the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical properties using machine learning models. This can help wine producers, quality inspectors, and enthusiasts understand the key factors influencing wine quality.
